# SelfDrivingCar
Implementation of a DQN to train an agent to drive a car using PyTorch and Kivy.

Repository includes the code for the Kivy environment and the Kivy object for the car (forked from <a href = 'https://github.com/PacktPublishing/AI-Crash-Course/blob/master/Chapter%2010/map_commented.py'>here</a>), as well as the code containing the DQN and ReplayMemory classes.

Completed as a final project for CS335 (Artificial Intelligence) at Brescia University.
